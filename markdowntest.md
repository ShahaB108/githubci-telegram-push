# DevOps Exam

This exam has 2 parts. 

+ Keep answers short.
+ English is better. Persian is OK.
+ You can use AI. Read your text once before you push.

## Start

1. Open [https://auth.fanap.kubelog.ir](https://auth.fanap.kubelog.ir)
2. Enter the last 4 digits of your phone number.
3. Run the setup commands on that page.
4. First SSH = Scenario 1. Second SSH = Scenario 2.

## Submit

1. Fork [https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template)
2. Keep the name `exam-template`. Make it public.
3. Send your public fork URL in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2tC9HDaLtJpzJGOU3seGmcdvb_liu8d9cHVXwOxGM8aeOvg/viewform) before **19:00**.
4. Work only on these branches:
  - [`doc-1`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/doc-1) — Scenario 1 write-up (`README.md`)
  - [`scenario-2`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/scenario-2) — Ansible code
  - [`doc-2`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/doc-2) — Scenario 2 write-up (`README.md`)
5. Do not commit after **19:00**.



## Scenario 1

Someone tried to run [service-catalog](https://github.com/fanapcampus/service-catalog) on the first VM and could not.
Files are in `/opt/service-catalog`. Read the files. Use this picture.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User(["User"]) -->|"graph / nodes / edges / impact"| LB["load balancer (nginx)"]
  LB --> API["backend"]
  API --> DB[("PostgreSQL")]
```



When it works:

```bash
curl http://localhost/graph
```

You need HTTP 200 and the proper output.

Write what you did on branch [`doc-1`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/doc-1).

## Scenario 2

On the second VM (or Vagrant), use Ansible to install:

- Prometheus on 9090
- Grafana on 3000
- node_exporter
- Grafana datasource = Prometheus
- one dashboard with CPU and memory

Start from branch [`scenario-2`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/scenario-2). Do not change the `inventory/` folder.
Put the user and IP in inventory.

I will run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml -b --private-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_fanap
```

The code must run.

Write the doc on branch [`doc-2`](https://github.com/fanapcampus/exam-template/tree/doc-2). Put Grafana user and password there.

## Score

Scenario 1(Find and fix matters most): 
    + find 30% 
    + fix 40% 
    + write-up doc 30%. 
    

Scenario 2: 
    + working code 50% 
    + write-up 50%.
If the code does not run, I only look at the doc quickly.
